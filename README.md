# 🌊 Aqua-Watch-AI

### 🔗 **Live Demo:** [https://aqua-watch-ai.streamlit.app/](https://aqua-watch-ai.streamlit.app/)

### 📘 Project Description

Aqua-Watch-AI is an AI-driven water quality monitoring and prediction system designed to help track, visualize, and forecast the condition of water bodies across India. Using **22 years of environmental data**, machine learning models, and a visually rich Streamlit dashboard, this project empowers citizens, researchers, and government bodies to make **data-driven decisions** about water pollution and sustainability.

Built with a mission to support environmental awareness and resource management, Aqua-Watch-AI transforms complex water quality metrics into clear, accessible insights — making pollution monitoring smarter, faster, and more accurate.
